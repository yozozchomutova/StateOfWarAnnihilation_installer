-Brightness of snow texture lowered (so it won't kill your eyes now)\n-Improved Unit placing panel (for easier use)\n-Improved other level editor UI elements...\n-The sky is now moving!\n-Fixed bug, where agreement would show, even if it didn't had to...\n-When you select White team, HP bar will automatically moves to 50%... Similar case, when selecting other team colour after leaving white one -> HP bar moves to 100%
